### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cassian Godsted. 

I'm a web developer, and sometimes I experiment with other languages. I also make Minecraft modpacks and mods (mostly ports, in that case)

I'm currently working at [Northern Kentucky University's College of Informatics](https://www.nku.edu/academics/informatics.html) as an Operations and Events Assistant, and at the [INTERalliance of Greater Cincinnati](https://interalliance.org) as the Internal Systems Admin. I'm also President of the [Norse IoT Club](https://norseiot.club) at Northern Kentucky University, where I study Computer Information Technology.

For a list of projects, [head over to my personal site](https://cassian.cc).

For the Minecraft projects, [head over to my Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/Cassian)!

For a more professional work history, [find me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cassiancc).

## A few of my noteworthy projects are...

- My work at INTERalliance! I've been the Internal Systems Admin at IA for the last four years, and I've managed [their site](https://interalliance.org) and the website for [TechOlympics](https://techolympics.org), the largest student run tech conference in the US since I started. While there, I also handled a full redesign of the website for [the Carnegie](https://thecarnegie.com) and [WiIT Cincy](https://wiitcincy.interalliance.org), and ongoing maintenance on our custom [Wiki Races](https://github.com/INTERallianceGC/WikiRaces) webapp.
- [Tier Away](https://tieraway.godsted.com)! Tier Away is an open source tier list designer, because you shouldn't need an account to make a private tier list.
- [Simply Infinite](https://modrinth.com/modpack/simply-infinite) is a personal favourite of mine. It's an optimization modpack for an April Fools update of Minecraft. A third of the mods in the pack have been ported by me to this version, it was a great learning experience. Always looking for more mods on that one, so if you know Java, get in touch!
- Norse IoT's [Website Workshops](http://norseiot.club/projects/)! I, alongside a few club members, taught NKU students the basics of HTML/CSS to make personal websites. I created six templates for people to work off of, and I'm proud of the results.

That's about it for me. Again, more details over on [cassian.cc](https://cassian.cc).
