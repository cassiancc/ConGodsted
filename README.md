### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cassian Godsted. 

I'm primarily a web developer, working in HTML/CSS/JS, and I have experience working with Python, NodeJS, and Wordpress. I also make mods and modpacks for Minecraft in Java.

I'm currently working at the [INTERalliance of Greater Cincinnati](https://interalliance.org) as the Internal Systems Admin, but I'm currenty looking for a full time role.

For a list of projects, [head over to my personal site](https://cassian.cc).

For the Minecraft projects, [head over to my Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/Cassian)!

For a more professional work history, [find me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cassiancc).

## A few of my noteworthy projects are...

- My work at INTERalliance! I've been the Internal Systems Admin at IA for the last four years, and I've managed [their site](https://interalliance.org) and the website for [TechOlympics](https://techolympics.org), the largest student run tech conference in the US since I started. While there, I also handled a full redesign of the website for [the Carnegie](https://thecarnegie.com) and [WiIT Cincy](https://wiitcincy.interalliance.org), and ongoing maintenance on our custom [Wiki Races](https://github.com/INTERallianceGC/WikiRaces) webapp.
- [Tier Away](https://tieraway.godsted.com)! Tier Away is an open source tier list designer, because you shouldn't need an account to make a private tier list.
- Norse IoT's [Website Workshops](http://norseiot.club/projects/)! I, alongside a few club members, taught NKU students the basics of HTML/CSS to make personal websites. I created six templates for people to work off of, and I'm proud of the results.
- [Simply Infinite](https://modrinth.com/modpack/simply-infinite) is a personal favourite of mine. It's a first of its kind optimization modpack for an April Fools update of Minecraft.
- [Pyrite](https://modrinth.com/mod/pyrite) is my first mod for Minecraft, adding more block variations, including dyed wood, dyed bricks, new material blocks and more to complete your colourful builds.


That's about it for me. Again, more details over on [cassian.cc](https://cassian.cc).
